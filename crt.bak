;; Data definition for a System-1: 
;; A System-1 is a (listof AL) 
;; where the keys will be the mods and the values are the remainders. 
;; For instance, if we have a system where an unknown nummber is congruent 
;; to 2(mod 3) and 7(mod 10), then we write the input as '((3 2) (10 7))
;; required that the input system has at least two elements in it. 

;; (crt-1 system) : computes the value of an unknown number given properties
;;                  as described by the system, or the string "no solution"
;;                  if there is no solution.
